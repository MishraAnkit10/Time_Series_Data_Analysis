# Time Series Data Analysis — US Construction Spending

This repository contains an end-to-end time series analysis and forecasting project built on **U.S. construction spending data**.  
The goal is to explore temporal patterns, apply classical forecasting models, and build a reusable framework for real-world economic time series problems.

The project is structured to be both **learning-oriented** and **portfolio-ready**, covering data ingestion, exploratory analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

---

## Project Objectives

- Understand trends, seasonality, and residual components in construction spending
- Apply baseline and classical forecasting techniques
- Compare model performance
- Build reproducible analysis pipelines using Python + Quarto
- Create a modular foundation for future time series projects

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- statsforecast
- openpyxl
- Quarto

---

## Workflow

1. Load and preprocess construction spending data
2. Perform exploratory time series analysis
3. Decompose series (trend / seasonality / residuals)
4. Apply baseline forecasting models:
   - Naive
   - Seasonal Naive
   - Random Walk with Drift
   - Historical Average
   - Window Average
5. Evaluate forecasts
6. Visualize results
7. Document findings using Quarto
